## 1st sprint
The project allows the user to create a simple blockchain. After starting the program, the user interface can be seen in the terminal. The user can add another block / transaction (at this stage it is assumed that one block contains only one transaction) or display all blocks in the blockchain.

After selecting option [1], the user must provide the names of sender and recipient.

Then it is checked whether the hash in the new block is the same as the hash based on the data from the previous block. Information about both hashes and the validation process is displayed in the terminal.
